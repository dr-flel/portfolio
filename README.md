This repo contains a selection of problems and the solutions I’ve recently worked on. These are conceptual exercises rather than real‑world business cases, and the solutions are intended to illustrate an approach rather than serve as exhaustive or complete implementations.

1. Generalized Monty Hall Problem
2. Commodity News Sentiment Classifier
3. Ensemble Forecasting (Rossmann Store Sales Kaggle)
