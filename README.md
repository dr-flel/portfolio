This repo contains a selection of problems and the solutions I’ve recently worked on. These are conceptual exercises rather than real‑world business cases, and the solutions are intended to illustrate an approach rather than serve as exhaustive or complete implementations.

1. Generalized Monty Hall Problem
2. Commodity-News Sentiment Classifier
3. Ensemble Forecasting - Kaggle: Rossmann Store Sales
4. Subscription-Based Revenue Projection from Segmented Forecasts of Gross Adds and Churn
5. Modelling Persistent Intervention Effects on Event Rates (Frequentist & Bayesian Poisson Regression)
   5.a. Introducing Decaying Effects (Profile-likelihood MLE and Boostrap Standard Errors)
